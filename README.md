## Project Design Ideas

* [] Tab interface with left side nav
    * [] Tabs consist of different todos for home, today, tomorrow, future
* [] Date functionality on todos
* [] Should show a list of completed todos per tab AND globally on a home page
* [] Headings. How do I make that possible?
* [] Depending on the page, todo gets added to that specific list
    * [] Global list needs to hold all todos
    * [] There should be a separate list for completed and not completed tasks
